		Hola, I am Mex a senior in Aiea High school that will be graduationg in 2023. I am 18 years old I was born 2004 in Mexico. When I was 9 I came to Hawaii,U.S. I am a mix between Mexican and American culture. I have parts of my family in both countries so there is never a full gathering. 
	
		<h2> What I Do For Fun </h2>	
			<p class="solid_left">
	I enjoy hanging out with my friends during school and talking to them after school. During the weekend I mostly play video games. My favorite style of video games are open worlds where you have complete freedom in your actions. That is why my favorite game is Minceraft. In addition to playing games I also watch Youtube and anime.
